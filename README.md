I've created a modern, responsive agency landing page with all the requested features. The page includes:

A sticky navigation bar with a collapsible mobile menu
A hero section with a background image and CTA buttons
A services section showcasing key offerings
A portfolio section with hover effects
A testimonials section
A contact form with contact information
A detailed footer with multiple columns
A back-to-top button that appears when scrolling
Smooth scrolling navigation
Fully responsive design for all screen sizes
The code is organized into small, focused components for better maintainability:

Layout components (Navbar, Footer)
Section components (Hero, Services, Portfolio, etc.)
UI components (BackToTop)
All components use Tailwind CSS for styling and Lucide React for icons. The design is modern, 
professional, and production-ready with smooth animations and transitions.
